Welcome to Twiline [[download_button]]
=========

Twiline tries to make transcriptions of interviews easier. This is done by providing a simple text editor in conjunction with a keyboard controllable player.

Up to now it mostly resembles its archetype F4. The need for this clone arose because F4 does not run under Linux, which is a major problem at least for me. As if this is not enough, the current version is only usable for the first ten minutes of a interview without paying.

**Warning**: this program is in a very early development state. So not all may work as expected.

Features and limitations
------
* Load and save your transcript as RTF which can easily be imported into word processors
* No need for a mouse to stop, rewind and play again
* Support for bold, italic and underlined text
* insert time stamp of the current position
* Adjust playback speed to your personal needs
* tested under Linux and Windows

As this program is a quick hack, not everything is perfect. For instance it only accepts plain WAV files.

Installation
----------
The program is written in Java so it needs a JRE to run. If you don't already have one installed you can download it from [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Although not proven, the JRE should be at least version 7.

Further installation is pretty simple: just download Twiline from the [files](https://sourceforge.net/projects/twiline/files/) section and double click it.

Usage
-----
To start a new transcription use the *Open Audio* button and select the recording to work on. As mentioned before it needs to be in the WAV format.

Playback is controlled either by the buttons with the obvious meanings or the keyboard. *Alt-Up* starts playing, *Alt-Down* stops playing. You can rewind or go forward with *Alt-Left* and *Alt-Right* resp.
Typing the text is the same as with very simple word processors. Besides the buttons for bold, italic and underline you can also use *Ctrl-B*, *Ctrl-I* and *Ctrl-U*. The same holds for undo/redo which are available at *Ctrl-Z* and *Ctrl-Shift-Z*.
Frequently used phrases may be assigned to the keys *Alt-0* up to *Alt-9* in the *Settings* dialog.

To save your work, press *Ctrl-S*. To make it easy for your OS to get your file recognized as rich text format, you should choose the extension "rtf".
